## Feature Breakdown
### User Management
User management provides secure authentication and profile systems allowing guests and hosts to create accounts, manage their profiles, and build reputation in the community. This feature forms the foundation of the platform's identity system, enabling personalized experiences and account-specific functionalities.

### Property Management
Property management enables hosts to create, update, and manage their property listings with detailed descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability calendars. This core feature gives property owners control over their listings while providing potential guests with comprehensive information needed to make informed booking decisions.

### Booking System
The booking system facilitates the reservation process from initial search to confirmation, handling date selection, pricing calculations, and booking status tracking. It serves as the primary transaction mechanism of the platform, coordinating the critical connection between guests seeking accommodations and hosts offering their properties.

### Review and Rating System
This feature allows guests to provide feedback and ratings after their stays, building trust in the community and helping future guests make informed decisions. The system also enables hosts to respond to reviews, creating transparent communication channels that enhance the platform's reliability.

### Search and Filtering
Advanced search functionality lets users find properties based on location, price range, amenities, dates, and other criteria for a tailored browsing experience. This discovery mechanism optimizes the user experience by efficiently connecting guests with relevant property listings that match their specific requirements.

### Payment Processing
Secure payment processing handles transactions between guests and hosts, including initial payments, refunds, and host payouts. This critical infrastructure ensures financial security while managing the monetary aspects of bookings with appropriate fee calculations and payment status tracking.

### Messaging System
An integrated messaging system enables direct communication between hosts and guests before, during, and after bookings for questions, coordination, and support. This feature facilitates clear communication channels that are essential for addressing specific needs and building trust between users.
## API Security
## Security Implementation

### Key Security Measures

1. **Authentication**
    - Multi-factor authentication for user accounts
    - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure session management
    - Secure password storage with bcrypt hashing

2. **Authorization**
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) system
    - Principle of least privilege for all system components
    - Fine-grained permission system for resource access

3. **API Protection**
    - Rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks
    - Request validation using schema verification
    - API keys with proper secret management

4. **Data Protection**
    - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
    - Data masking for personally identifiable information (PII)
    - Database encryption at rest

5. **Network Security**
    - TLS/SSL implementation for all connections
    - Proper CORS configuration
    - Web Application Firewall (WAF) integration

### Security Rationale

- **User Data Protection**: Implementing strong authentication and data encryption ensures user privacy and builds trust in our platform.

- **Transaction Security**: Securing payment flows with encryption and authorization controls protects both our users and our business from financial fraud.

- **System Integrity**: Rate limiting and validation prevent system abuse, ensuring consistent performance and availability for all users.

- **Compliance**: Our security measures help ensure compliance with relevant regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and industry standards.

- **Threat Mitigation**: Implementing defense-in-depth security measures creates multiple layers of protection against evolving cyber threats.
